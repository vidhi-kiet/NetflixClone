- **Movie List:** Show a grid of movie posters within each category. Users can scroll through the movies to explore more options.

- **Movie Modal:** When users click on a movie poster, a modal popup appears with more details about the selected movie, such as its synopsis, release year, and rating.

- **Responsive Design:** The project is fully responsive, adapting smoothly to different screen sizes and devices.
